# Finger Fight: decisions

- **Separate project from `fingers/`.** That app is a single page counting fingers; this one reuses its counting logic (in `js/gestures.js`, now aspect-ratio aware) and the same MediaPipe CDN setup.
- **Web app on GitHub Pages, PeerJS (WebRTC) for the room code.** No server of ours. The camera needs https, hence Pages. PeerJS is bundled (`vendor/`, 1.5.4, 93 KB); MediaPipe stays on the CDN (about 17 MB once per player).
- **Both players use fingers.** Pointer's count = the answer; guesser's count = the guess (0 = fist, no hand seen = no guess = a miss). Photos from both sides are shown at the reveal.
- **Damage rules** (`logic.js`, tested): right guess = guesser hits pointer for 1; wrong guess + pointer gesture = pointer crits the guesser (middle 2, moutza 2, sideways 3); otherwise a miss; pointer hiding their hand forfeits (guesser hits for 1). Only the pointer's gestures score, so gestures can't be spammed to win: a right guess beats them.
- **Both phones compute the result from the same inputs** (`resolveRound`), the host only paces the rounds. No authority server, so a modified client could lie about its own count/gesture; accepted for a friendly game.
- **Never trust the network:** names, guesses and reveals are validated (`validReveal`, `validGuessMsg`, `sanitizeName`); photos must be small inline JPEGs; the DOM is built with `textContent`, never `innerHTML` with remote text.
- **Gestures are geometry on MediaPipe landmarks, not a classifier.** Thresholds are in `gestures.js` (`MOUTZA_SPREAD`, `SIDEWAYS_RANGE`). Not tuned on real hands yet. Palm vs back of hand is not detected.
- **Simulator mode `?sim=1`** replaces the camera with tap controls. It is how the end-to-end tests run, and lets one person test the flow without a camera.
- **Tests run on a fake DOM + fake PeerJS** (`tests/harness.js`), driving the real `main.js`. The fake DOM mimics real behaviour where it matters (dataset and textContent are strings); keep it honest.
- **WebView lesson from Lab Calc:** if a canvas/viewer is ever embedded in a WebView, size it in pixels (percentage heights resolved to 0 there).
